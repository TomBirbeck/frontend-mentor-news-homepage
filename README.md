## My process

Initially I set the padding and margin to 0 and changed the box-sizing to border-box so tht I would be able to accurately design the layout. I then created the custom variables for the different colours that would be used for the design and imported the required font and font-weights.\
I then began to build out the HTML frame for the page and style as needed. It was at this point that I had an issue with using grid-template-areas, upon reaching out to the Frontend Masters community I was given advice to restructure my HTML, this enabled me to gain a better perspective on the design.\
After restructing the page, I then corrected my styling.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge ended up being very useful for learning about HTML structure and grid displays.

### Continued development

This would be a good base for building out a full news website.
